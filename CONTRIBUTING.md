# Contributing to Playable

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use [conventionalcommits](https://conventionalcommits.org/spec/v1.0.0-beta.1.html) to format our commit messages.  This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
we use the git commit messages to generate the [Playable release notes](https://github.com/wix/playable/releases).
